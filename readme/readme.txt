plugin for CudaText.
allows to call Dash help files (doc-sets) from CudaText. search is made from selected text, or current word if none is selected.

for macOS, you must install Dash app.
for Windows/Linux, install similar Zeal app, it uses Dash doc-sets too. https://zealdocs.org/

after installing, enable some doc-sets in Dash/Zeal options.
not all syntaxes have doc-sets, but main popular syntaxes do.

plugin gives commands for 2 main options:
- call help syntax-sensitive or not (ie, consider lexer name)
- run app in background or foreground
